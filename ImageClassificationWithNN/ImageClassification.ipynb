    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "The original goal of this project was to build a basic feedforward neural network to classify animal images (`dog`, `elephant`, `butterfly`) from the Animals-10 dataset. Throughout the development process, several key modifications were made to improve model performance, stability, and training correctness. Below is a complete list of all refinements and theoretical insights added along the way:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Model Architecture Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "| Update | Description |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Increased Neurons** | Changed architecture from a minimal 3-2-1 structure to a deeper network with more neurons in each layer, enabling the model to learn more complex patterns. |\n",
    "| **Changed Activation to ReLU** | Replaced `Sigmoid` with `ReLU` in hidden layers for better convergence, especially in deeper networks. |\n",
    "| **Reason** | ReLU avoids the vanishing gradient problem and speeds up training compared to Sigmoid. |\n",
    "| **Final Output Layer** | For multi-class output, the final layer outputs raw logits instead of sigmoid probabilities. |\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Loss Function Transition\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 Why We Changed the Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect                  | Details                                                                 |\n",
    "|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Initial Choice**      | `Binary Cross Entropy (BCE)`                                            |\n",
    "| **Issue**               | BCE is only suitable for **binary classification** tasks.               |\n",
    "|                         | We are solving a **multi-class** problem (e.g., dog, butterfly, elephant). |\n",
