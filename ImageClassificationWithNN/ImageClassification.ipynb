    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "The original goal of this project was to build a basic feedforward neural network to classify animal images (`dog`, `elephant`, `butterfly`) from the Animals-10 dataset. Throughout the development process, several key modifications were made to improve model performance, stability, and training correctness. Below is a complete list of all refinements and theoretical insights added along the way:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Model Architecture Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "| Update | Description |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Increased Neurons** | Changed architecture from a minimal 3-2-1 structure to a deeper network with more neurons in each layer, enabling the model to learn more complex patterns. |\n",
    "| **Changed Activation to ReLU** | Replaced `Sigmoid` with `ReLU` in hidden layers for better convergence, especially in deeper networks. |\n",
    "| **Reason** | ReLU avoids the vanishing gradient problem and speeds up training compared to Sigmoid. |\n",
    "| **Final Output Layer** | For multi-class output, the final layer outputs raw logits instead of sigmoid probabilities. |\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Loss Function Transition\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 Why We Changed the Loss Function\n",

    "This iterative project evolved from a basic neural net to a well-structured, multi-class classification system with correct architectural, loss function, and dataset handling strategies. Each improvement addressed a specific challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inappropriate loss function → switched to `CrossEntropyLoss`\n",
    "- Vanishing gradients → switched to `ReLU`\n",
    "- Class imbalance → fixed with balanced sampling\n",
    "- Output mismatch → corrected with `argmax` + logits\n",
